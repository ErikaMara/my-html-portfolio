 <h1>The World's Best Movies According to Érika Mara :D</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

 <hr>

 <p>Tbh, I have no idea what are my favourite movies, so I'll just list the first 3 ones that come to mind, whatever.</p>

 <h3>A Fantátisca Fábrica de Chocolate</h3>
 <p> I really really like this one since I was a little kid, the version with Johnny Depp, tho.</p>

 <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
 <p>JK, I honestly couldn't care any less about this movie series, I don't even remember what happens in each movie, but it was nice watching it tho lol</p>

 <h3>Skins</h3>
 <p>Ok, I know this isn't a movie, it's a TV Series (Show?) Idk how to say that in english but I honestly couldn't think of any other movies</P>


<h4>That's it, hope you guys enjoyed my mediocre taste on movies and tv shows</h4>

<p> ok I remembered a movie that I like it's called spirited away</p>
